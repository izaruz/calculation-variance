## Calculation of variance

### What is the variance?
Variance is a measure of dispersion, a measure of how data values may differ from their mean. The variance is the arithmetic mean of the squares of the differences of the individual values of the means. The squared elevation ensures that the positive and negative values do not cancel each other out.

This calculator calculates the variance of a data set.
For the determination of the variance it is necessary to specify and the data belong to a sample of a population. Enter the values of the observations in the text field, delimited by commas.

In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling. Variance is an important tool in the sciences, where statistical analysis of data is common. The variance is the square of the standard deviation, the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself.
