## What is the variance?

In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling. Variance is an important tool in the sciences, where statistical analysis of data is common. The variance is the square of the standard deviation, the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself.

## Calculation of variance

The variance is calculated by 5 simple steps:

* Step 1: Calculate the sum of all the data
* Step 2: Calculate the mean
* Step 3: Subtract the mean to each data
* Step 4: Raise each result
* Step 5: Sum all the data and calculate the mean of the sum

The formula representing these steps is

```{r, echo=FALSE}
   knitr::include_graphics('https://izaruz.shinyapps.io/variance/_w_1feaf13a/fortmule.png')
```

## The core (server.R)

```{r echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
dataExample <- c(2,4,5,6,7)
n <- length(dataExample)
#Step 1:
total <- 0
    for(i in 1:n){total <- dataExample[i] + total}
#Step 2:
meanData <- total/n
#Step 3:
newData <- dataExample
    for(i in 1:n){newData[i] <- dataExample[i] - meanData}
#Step 4:
raiseData <- dataExample
    for(i in 1:n){raiseData[i] <- newData[i] * newData[i]}
#Step 5
variance <- 0
    for(i in 1:n){variance <- raiseData[i] + variance}
    variance <- variance/n

```

## Example

The user enters in the text box a vector c <- (2,4,5,6,7) And the calculator displays the data step by step, so that the user understands exactly the steps that are carried out.

```{r eval=TRUE}
dataExample <- c(2,4,5,6,7)
n <- length(dataExample)
#Step 1:
total <- 0
    for(i in 1:n){
      total <- dataExample[i] + total
    }
cat("The total sum is: ", total,"\n\n")
#Step 2:
meanData <- total/n
cat("The mean of the vector is: ", meanData,"\n\n")
#Step 3:
newData <- dataExample
    for(i in 1:n){
      newData[i] <- dataExample[i] - meanData
    }
cat("After subtracting the mean at each value 
        from vector 1 we obtain vector 2: ", newData,"\n\n")
#Step 4:
raiseData <- dataExample
    for(i in 1:n){
      raiseData[i] <- newData[i] * newData[i]
    }
cat("By squaring each term of vector 2 is obtained: ", raiseData,"\n\n")
#Step 5
variance <- 0
    for(i in 1:n){
      variance <- raiseData[i] + variance
    }
    variance <- variance/n
cat("After all the steps we obtain our variance: ", variance,"\n\n")

```
